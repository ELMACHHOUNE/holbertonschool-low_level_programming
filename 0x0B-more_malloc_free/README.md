## Synopsis
This repository holds some projects I worked on for Holberton School. The goal is to learn coding and concepts through the C programming language.

## Concepts to be learned in this repository:
* How to use the exit function
* What are the functions calloc and realloc from the standard library and how to use them

## Description of what each file shows:
0. a function that allocates memory using malloc
1. a function that concatenates two strings
2. a function that allocates memory for an array, using malloc
3. a function that creates an array of integers
100. a function that reallocates a memory block using malloc and free
101. a program that multiply two positive numbers
